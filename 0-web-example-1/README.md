# Professional CSS Course with Kevin Powell

This is a companion repository for the [Professional CSS](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/pro-css/) course on Frontend Masters.

### Course Website
- [Part 1](https://website-from-scratch-1.netlify.app/)
- [Part 2](https://website-from-scratch-2.netlify.app/)

These files are the step-by-step progress through the course project. The numbers correspond to the section of the course. For example, `part-1/04-start` would be the code at the start of _Section 4: The big picture_ from Part 1. 

I only provide starting points, because `05-start` would be the same as the ending of section 4.

I hope that you enjoy the course!
